### Introduction

Real-world data rarely come clean. Using Python and its libraries, we have gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. 

The dataset on which we have done wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter users [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, however? Almost always higher than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because ["they're good dogs, Brent."](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent) WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
